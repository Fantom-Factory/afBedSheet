Play on words from Tapestry, and Fantom ghosty wears a BedSheet!

Powerful, Flexible, Simple.

Why? Because people are lazy!

horizonal not vertical - other frameworks make you extend their classes, not BedSheet!

Fix'n'Go
 - No server restart
 - option to kill server
   - (maybe inject kill links into a html header... in dev mode)
 - too confusing having the one main method for 2 modes, seperate them out
 - restart process checks a timestamp file, or URL!!! yeah! and dies if URL invalid (dev only)
   
Mainly for REST, HTML a 2nd concern (e.g. no component generation)
  Easy Routing for HTTP, get, post, etc
  /index pages...?
  
  Routing default to XXXPage#httpMethod
  /foo/3/dude => FooPage.get(int 3, int dude) (does the fromStr thing to convert params)
   - allow value encoders service  

Map for non 200 status codes
 - special cases for 404, 500

servicePods (with & without vers)

Proxy session
 
Big Error page for 500
 - disabled in prod mode

Easy gzip

json

static files served under 'hash' folder
 - Asset class, File field and genned file field
 
template files served under version number

RequireJS module support 

use the tales JS compiler! A bloody neat idea!

Pluggable Template generation
 - moustache
 - tales
