
BedSheet::BedServer.toLocalUriFromClientUri()??

BedSheet Stats --- put in BedServer?
 - Uptime
 - No of http reqs / res
 - Http status code
 - list sessions
Historical TS data?

Have a BedSheetStatsListener, make a default impl (in afBedSheetStats) that keeps stats in memory and makes pretty charts?

New BedSheet project to serve serve static files from the cmd line
	* see https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server 



Bad Ideas
=========

BedServer.toAbsoluteUrl() - should be able to convert both client AND local Urls
 - problematic because we DON'T know if a url IS local or not - 'cos what if the local url starts with a repeated modBase?
 - AND we would only care if BedSheet is used in a nested Mod - which we've never done!


BedSheet to log middleware and routes to DEBUG -> easy to turn on and off
 - how is this different to the Default Request Logger that logs to DEBUG?
