Overview [#overview]
********************
BedSheet is a [Fantom]`http://fantom.org/` framework for delivering web applications. Built on top of
[afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` and [Wisp]`http://fantom.org/doc/wisp/index.html`,
BedSheet aims to be: Powerful, Flexible and Simple.

BedSheet is inspired by Java's [Tapestry5]`http://tapestry.apache.org/`, Ruby's [Sinatra]`http://www.sinatrarb.com/` and
Fantom's [Draft]`https://bitbucket.org/afrankvt/draft`.

Quick Start [#quickStart]
*************************

1. Create an 'AppModule', this is where all your service configuration will go.
2. Contribute to 'Routes' and other services
3. Create some page / request handlers
4. Start the app...

pre>
using afBedSheet
using afIoc

class AppModule {
  @Contribute
  static Void contributeRoutes(OrderedConfig conf) {
    conf.add(Route(`/hello/**`, HelloPage#hello))
  }
}

class HelloPage {
  TextResponse hello(Str name, Int iq := 666) {
    return TextResponse.fromPlain("Hello! I'm $name and I have an IQ of $iq!")
  }
}
<pre

From the command line:

pre>
$ fan afBedSheet <mypod>::AppModule 8080
...
BedSheet v1.0 started up in 323ms

$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello/Traci/69
Hello! I'm Traci and I have an IQ of 69!

$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello/Luci
Hello! I'm Luci and I have an IQ of 666!
<pre

Wow! That's awesome! But what just happened!?

Every application has an 'AppModule' that is used to contribute to [afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview`
services. In our 'AppModule' we told the `Routes` service to route all request uris, that start with '/hello', to our
'HelloPage' class. `Route` converts any extra uri path segments into method arguments, or in our case, a 'Str name' and an
optional 'Int iq'.

Request handlers are typically what we, the app developers, write. They perform logic processing and render responses. Our
'HelloPage' handler simply renders a `TextResponse`.

A default `ResponseProcessor` then sends our `TextResponse` to the client.



Starting BedSheet [#startingBedSheet]
*************************************
BedSheet may be started from the command line using:

pre>
$ fan afBedSheet <fully-qualified-app-module-name> <port-number>
<pre

Every BedSheet web application has an 'AppModule' class that defines and configures your
[afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` services. It is an
[afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` concept that allows you centralise your app configuration in one place.

> TIP: Should your AppModule grow too big, break logical chunks out into their own classes using the afIoc @SubModule facet.

You may find it more convenient to create your own BedSheet Main wrapper. (In fact, if using
[Heroku]`https://bitbucket.org/SlimerDude/heroku-buildpack-fantom` you have to.)

pre>
using util

class Main : AbstractMain {

  @Arg { help="The HTTP port to run the app on" }
  private Int port

  override Int run() {
    return afBedSheet::Main().main("<fully-qualified-app-module-name> $port".split)
  }
}
<pre

'<fully-qualified-app-module-name>' may be replaced with '<pod-name>' as long as your pod's 'build.fan' defines the following
meta:

pre>
meta  = [ ...
          ...
          "afIoc.module"  : "<fully-qualified-app-module-name>"
        ]
<pre

Note that 'AppModule' is named so out of convention but may be called anything you like.



Request Routing [#requestRouting]
*********************************
When BedSheet receives a web request, it is matched to a handler for processing. This is configured through the `Routes` service.

pre>
@Contribute { serviceType=Routes# }
static Void contributeRoutes(OrderedConfig conf) {

  conf.add(Route(`/index`, IndexPage#service))
}
<pre

BedSheet is bundled with the following Route objs:
 - `Route`: Matches against the request URI, converting deeper path segments into method arguments.

If the handler returns 'Void' or 'null' then processing is passed onto the next matching route. This makes it possible to
create filter like handlers that pre-process a blanket wide set of uris. To do this, contribute a placeholder that all routes
(ordered or unordered) naturally come after. Example:

pre>
@Contribute { serviceType=Routes# }
static Void contributeRoutes(OrderedConfig conf) {

  conf.addPlaceholder("routes")

  // routes
  conf.add(Route(`/index`, IndexPage#service))
  ...

  // filters - addOrdered to ensure they come before routes
  conf.addOrdered("AuthFilter", Route(`/admin/***`, AuthFilter#service), ["before: routes"])
}
<pre

BedSheet bundles with the following filters:
 - `RequestLogFilter` : Generate a server log file of all HTTP requests.
 - `CrossOriginResourceSharingFilter` : Allows ajax cross domain scripting.
 - `IeAjaxCacheBustingFilter` : Prevents [Internet Explorer]`https://twitter.com/1Pr0grammer/status/238015103910420480/photo/1` from caching Ajax and CORS requests.

Routes are not limited to matching against uris, you can create your own routes that match against anything, such as http
headers or the time of day! Just create a `RouteMatcher` and contribute it to `RouteMatchers`.

Routing lesson over.

(...you Aussies may stop giggling now.)



Request Handling [#requestHandling]
***********************************
Request handlers is where logic is processed and responses are rendered. Handlers generally shouldn't pipe anything to
'Response.out'. Instead they should return a response object. Example, the above 'HelloPage' handler returns a
`TextResponse`.

BedSheet bundles with the following request handlers:
 - `FileHandler`: Maps request URIs to files on file system.
 - `PodHandler` : Maps request URIs to pod file resources.

By default, BedSheet handles the following responses:
 - 'Void' / 'null' / 'false' : Processing should fall through to the next Route match.
 - 'true' : A response has been sent to the client and no further processing should performed on the http request.
 - `TextResponse` : The text (be it plain, json or xml), with the given `sys::MimeType` is sent to the client.
 - `sys::File` : The file is sent to the client.
 - `HttpStatus` : Sets the http response status and renders a mini html page with the status msg. (See [Error Processing]`#errorProcessing`.)
 - `Redirect` : Sends a 3xx redirect response to the client.



Response Processing [#responseProcessing]
*****************************************
[ResponseProcessors]`ResponseProcessor` process request handler responses (`sys::File`, `TextResponse`, etc...) and send data to
the client. 'ResponseProcessors' should return 'true' if no further processing should performed on the http request. Or they
may return another response object for further processing, such as a `TextResponse`.

BedSheet bundles with the following response processors:
 - 'TextResponseProcessor' : Sends text to the client.
 - 'FileResponseProcessor' : Sends files to the client.
 - 'RedirectResponseProcessor' : Sends a 3xx redirect responses to the client.
 - `HttpStatusProcessors` : Routes `HttpStatus` to contributed 'HttpStatusProcessors'.



Error Processing [#errorProcessing]
***********************************
When BedSheet catches an Err it scans through its list of contributed [ErrProcessors]`ErrProcessor` to find the closest match.
ErrProcessor's takes an Err and returns a response for further processing (example, `TextResponse`). Or it may return 'true'
if the error has been completely handled and no further processing is required.

BedSheet bundles with Err processors for the following Errs:
 - 'HttpStatusErr' : Returns the wrapped `HttpStatus`.
 - 'Err' : A general catch all processor that wraps (and returns) the Err in a `HttpStatus` 500.

'HttpStatus' responses are handled by `HttpStatusProcessors` which selects a contributed processor dependent on the http status
code. The only specific `HttpStatusProcessor` that BedSheet bundles with is for a 500 Internal Server Error.

Example code to override the 500 Internal Server Error handler and set a 404 Not Found page:

pre>
  @Contribute { serviceType=HttpStatusProcessors# }
  static Void contributeHttpStatusProcessors(MappedConfig conf) {
    conf[404] = conf.autobuild(Page404#)

    // need to override the 500 page because BedSheet supplies one by default
    conf.setOverride(500, "MyErrPage", conf.autobuild(Page500#))
  }
<pre

There is a default catch all 'HttpStatusProcessor' which sets the http status and sends a mini html page to the client. The
page is set via the Config mechanism so to set your own, contribute to `ApplicationDefaults`:

pre>
  @Contribute { serviceType=ApplicationDefaults# }
  static Void contributeApplicationDefaults(MappedConfig conf) {
    ...
    conf[ConfigIds.httpStatusDefaultPage] = MyStatusPage()
    ...
  }
<pre



Config [#config]
****************
BedSheet extends [afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` to give injectable '@Config' values. '@Config' values
are essesntially a map of Str to immutable / constant values that may be set and overriden at application start up.

BedSheet sets the initial config values by contributing to the `FactoryDefaults` service. An application may then override
these values by contibuting to the `ApplicationDefaults` service.

pre>
  @Contribute { serviceType=ApplicationDefaults# }
  static Void contributeApplicationDefaults(MappedConfig conf) {
    ...
    conf["afBedSheet.errPrinter.noOfStackFrames"] = 100
    ...
  }
<pre

All BedSheet config keys are listed in `ConfigIds` meaning the above can be more safely rewriten as:

pre>
    conf[ConfigIds.noOfStackFrames] = 100
<pre

To inject config values in your services, use the '@Config' facet with conjunction with
[afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview`'s '@Inject':

pre>
	@Inject	@Config { id="afBedSheet.errPrinter.noOfStackFrames" }
	Int noOfStackFrames
<pre

The config mechanism is not just for BedSheet, you can use it too when creating add-on libraries! Contributing to
`FactoryDefaults` gives users of your library an easy way to override your values.



Development Proxy [#DevelopmentProxy]
*************************************
You need never (manually) restart your app again!

Use the '-proxy' option to create a Development Proxy to auto re-start your app when any of your pods are updated:

pre>
$ fan afBedSheet -proxy <mypod> <port>
<pre

The proxy sits on '<port>', starts your real app on '<port>+1' and forwards all requests to it.

pre>
  Client <--> Proxy (port) <--> Web App (port+1)
<pre

A problem other (Fantom) web development proxies suffer from, is that when the proxy dies your real web app is left hanging
around; requiring you to manually kill it.

pre>
  Client <-->   ????????   <--> Web App (port+1)
<pre

BedSheet goes a step further and, should it be started in proxy mode, it pings the proxy every second to stay alive. Should
the proxy not respond, the web app kills itself.

See `ConfigIds.proxyPingInterval` for more details.



Gzip [#gzip]
************
By default, BedSheet compresses HTTP responses with gzip where it can.(1) But it doesn't do this willy nilly, oh no! There are
many hurdles to overcome...

Disable All [#disablePerWebApp]
-------------------------------
Gzip, although enabled by default, can be disabled for the entire web app by setting the following config property:

    config[ConfigIds.gzipDisabled] = true

Disable per Response [#disablePerResponse]
------------------------------------------
Gzip can be disabled on a per request / response basis by calling the following:

    httpResponse.disableGzip()

Gzip'able Mime Types [#mimeTypes]
---------------------------------
Not everything should be gzipped. For example, text files gzip very well and yield high compression rates. JPG images on the
other hand, because they're already compressed, don't gzip well and can end up bigger than the original! For this reason you
must contribute to the `GzipCompressible` service to enable gzip for specified [Mime Types]`sys::MimeType`:

    config["text/funky"] = true

(Note: The GzipCompressible contrib type is actually `MimeType` - [afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview`
kindly coerces the 'Str' to 'MimeType' for us.)

By default BedSheet will compress plain text, css, html, javascript, xml, json and other text responses.

Gzip only when asked [#askNicely]
---------------------------------
Guaranteed that someone, somewhere is still using Internet Explorer 3.0 and they can't handle gzipped content. As such,
and as per [RFC 2616 HTTP1.1 Sec14.3]`http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.3`, we only gzip the
response if the client actually *asked* for it!

Minimum content threshold [#minThreshold]
-----------------------------------------
Gzip is great when compressing large files, but if you've only got a few bytes to squash... the compressed version is
going to be bigger, which kinda defeats the point of using gzip in the first place! For that reason the response data must
reach a minimum size / threshold before it gets gzipped.

See `GzipOutStream` and `ConfigIds.gzipThreshold` for more details.

Phew! Made it! [#madeIt]
------------------------
If (and only if!) your request passed all the tests above, will it then be lovingly gzipped and sent to the client.

Buffered Response [#bufferedResponse]
*************************************
By default, BedSheet attempts to set the 'Content-Length' http response header.(2) It does this by buffering
'HttpResponse.out'. When the stream is closed, it writes the 'Content-Length' and pipes the buffer to the real http response.

Response buffering can be disabled on a per http response basis.

A threshold can be set, whereby if the buffer exeeds that value, all content is streamed directly to the client.

See `BufferedOutStream` and `ConfigIds.responseBufferThreshold` for more details.

More! [#more]
*************
All request handlers and processors are built by [afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` so feel free to '@Inject'
DAOs and other services. BedSheet itself is built with [afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` so look at the
[BedSheet source]`XXX` for [afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` examples.

> TIP: 'const' handler classes are cached by BedSheet and reused on every request.
