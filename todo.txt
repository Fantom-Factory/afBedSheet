Doc Comments
------------

There's a blury line between handlers and processors which I'm not happy about. It's not convienient for all handlers to return a Obj.
 - wot about redirects? Str is overused: mustache, html, xml, etc... 
e.g. what should each do? 
 - how to distinquish between pod resource and file resource -> is there?
  - both return a file, diff handlers for diff uris.

how to return a redirect?
 - should uri's be resolved?  

Play on words from Tapestry, and Fantom ghosty wears a BedSheet! Wot Fantom wears!

"A web app framework that gets you horizontal. What's your favourite position?"

horizonal not vertical - other frameworks make you extend their classes, not BedSheet!



Good Stuff
 - ajax responses are gzipped by default
 - cache headers are set from ajax calls from IE
