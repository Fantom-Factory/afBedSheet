
FileHandler - allow multiple dirs to serve the same uri, auto add to routes with placeholders, add to docs
PodHandler, do the same

After Ioc1.5 - blog how to instantiate a 2nd Filehandler to map 2 dirs to the one url

Allow WispSession to be overridden - can we add BsWebMod to a normal wisp web app??
 - document how to use BedSheet with normal wisp


For BedSheet 1.3.0

Check the 'accept' header before we return content

??? Configure RouteHandlers to take other non-service classes

(*) Have afIoc call the RouteHandlers so they can take services.
   - not urgent as handlers can @Inject services

(*) Have Before and After routes

(*) Have req.data - an easy map store -> store in WebReq?

(*) Remove req.cookies and res.cookies and replace with intelligent HttpCookies service

Doc customising the ErrPrinters! Make them public?

make HttpRequestWrapper / HttpResponseWrapper public?

Logging filter with reqId, SessId and configurable userId

Err500 - have filter stack frames checkbox?

	static Void main(Str[] args) {
		kB := Unit.fromStr("kB")
		b := Unit.fromStr("byte")
	
		size := kB.convertTo(3f, b)
		Env.cur.err.printLine(size)
	}



Future
------

static files & pod files served under 'hash' folder
 - Asset class, File field and genned file field
 
template files served under version number

RequireJS module support 

Tale integration - http://fantom.org/sidewalk/topic/1290
 - templates
 - routing
 - the JS compiler! A bloody neat idea!
 - anything else?
 
Create an afBedSheetProtection pod, based on Rubys Rack::Protection


Naa
===
contribute ranges to HttpStatusProcessor?? - Naa, can't be arsed. Use case?



Doc Comments
------------
Play on words from Tapestry, and Fantom ghosty wears a BedSheet! Wot Fantom wears!

"A web app framework that gets you horizontal. What's your favourite position?"

horizonal not vertical - other frameworks make you extend their classes, not BedSheet.


Powerful.
Built in a modular way with [afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` meaning every service maybe wrapped,
decorated, replaced or deleted! It makes hard tasks, easy.

Flexible.
Show a developer a really cool feature and the first response is usually, "Wow, that's awewome! ... But how do I turn it off?"
With that in mind, BedSheet is reluctant

Simple.
Developers are lazy. If it's complicated or difficult, they won't use it.
