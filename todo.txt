Doc customising the ErrPrinters! Make them public?

Have afIoc call the RouteHandlers so they can take services.
 - not urgent as handlers can @Inject services

BedClient (test) post reqs and req.in

Logging filter with reqId, SessId and configurable userId

Err500 - have filter stack frames checkbox?

	static Void main(Str[] args) {
		kB := Unit.fromStr("kB")
		b := Unit.fromStr("byte")
	
		size := kB.convertTo(3f, b)
		Env.cur.err.printLine(size)
	}

make HttpRequestWrapper / HttpResponseWrapper public?

Remove req.cookies and res.cookies and replace with intelligent HttpCookies service

Investigate why bs-proxy takes 10s to render page through Firefox.

Front more services with mixins

Future
------
 - have Dev / Prod mode (and other envs)

static files & pod files served under 'hash' folder
 - Asset class, File field and genned file field
 
template files served under version number

read config from files

RequireJS module support 

Tale integration - http://fantom.org/sidewalk/topic/1290
 - templates
 - routing
 - the JS compiler! A bloody neat idea!
 - anything else?
 
Move the non-standard filters (Cors / IE) out into an afBedSheetUtils pod / afBedSheetContrib

Create an afBedSheetProtection pod, based on Rubys Rack::Protection



Doc Comments
------------
Play on words from Tapestry, and Fantom ghosty wears a BedSheet! Wot Fantom wears!

"A web app framework that gets you horizontal. What's your favourite position?"

horizonal not vertical - other frameworks make you extend their classes, not BedSheet.


Powerful.
Built in a modular way with [afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` meaning every service maybe wrapped,
decorated, replaced or deleted! It makes hard tasks, easy.

Flexible.
Show a developer a really cool feature and the first response is usually, "Wow, that's awewome! ... But how do I turn it off?"
With that in mind, BedSheet is reluctant

Simple.
Developers are lazy. If it's complicated or difficult, they won't use it.
