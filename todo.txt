For BedSheet 1.1.0

 filters or @Before and @After, but I like the idea of filters being able to intercept the req / res

 - @Persist { strategy="session" } - how to access setter?
 - @Persist { strategy="flash" }
 - @Flash or have HttpFlash["msg"] = "Hello!"



Future
------
 - have Dev / Prod mode (and other envs)

static files & pod files served under 'hash' folder
 - Asset class, File field and genned file field
 
template files served under version number

read config from files

RequireJS module support 

Tale integration - http://fantom.org/sidewalk/topic/1290
 - templates
 - routing
 - the JS compiler! A bloody neat idea!
 - anything else?
 
Move the non-standard filters (Cors / IE) out into an afBedSheetUtils pod

Create an afBedSheetProtection pod, based on Rubys Rack::Protection



Doc Comments
------------

Wot should be returned for redirects? Str is overused: mustache, html, xml, etc... 
e.g. what should each do? 
 - how to distinquish between pod resource and file resource -> is there?
  - both return a file, diff handlers for diff uris.

how to return a redirect?
 - should uri's be resolved?  

Play on words from Tapestry, and Fantom ghosty wears a BedSheet! Wot Fantom wears!

"A web app framework that gets you horizontal. What's your favourite position?"

horizonal not vertical - other frameworks make you extend their classes, not BedSheet!



Powerful.
---------
Built in a modular way with [afIoc]`http://repo.status302.com/doc/afIoc/#overview` meaning every service maybe wrapped,
decorated, replaced or deleted! It makes hard tasks, easy.

Flexible.
---------
Show a developer a really cool feature and the first response is usually, "Wow, that's awewome! ... But how do I turn it off?"
With that in mind, BedSheet is reluctant

Simple.
-------
Developers are lazy. If it's complicated or difficult, they won't use it.
