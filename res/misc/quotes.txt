Any fool can use a computer. Many do.
Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window.
If at first you don't succeed; call it version 1.0.
Programmers convert caffeine into code.
Hey! It compiles! Ship it!
An idiot with a computer is a faster, better idiot.
First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
Good web applications should look like trifle.
Booleans: they're only ever wrong by a bit!
A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than  any other invention with the possible exceptions of handguns and Tequila.
Computers are like Old Testament gods;              lots of rules and no mercy.
To err is human - and to blame it on a computer is  even more so.
No one ever said on their deathbed, 'Gee, I wish I  had spent more time alone with my computer'.
Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have   to support it for the rest of your life.
I can't uninstall it, there seems to be some kind   of "Uninstall Shield"!?
The Internet: where men are men, women are men, and children are FBI agents.
A computer once beat me at chess, but it was no     match for me at kick boxing.
